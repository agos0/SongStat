# SongStat

## An app, powered by the Spotify API, that allows you to:

* see your listening history and top songs in time frame of choice
* generate reccomendations on genres you choose
* create visuals for your listening distribution 

## Unfortunately, Spotify needs a company to extend the user quota, which I don't have. But, the progress and outcome of the app is shown here!


## History Images

## Even though I can't scale it, the app was fun to finish.
